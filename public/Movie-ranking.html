<H1>The Best Movies According to Damini</H1>
<h2> My Top 3 Movies of All Time </h2>
<hr/>
<h3> Mr and Mrs Smith</h3>
<p> This is the perfect balance of romance, action and comedy in my opinion. 
    I also think Angelina Jolie is very beautiful.</p>
<h3> Pretty Woman</h3>
<p> A true classic. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere gave an amazing performance. </p>
<h3> Gone in 60 Seconds </h3>
<p> One of those movies a lot of people might not know but one of the best graand
    auto movies of all time! Nicolas Cage gave an outstanding performance in this 
    movie. </p> <p>Also, Angelina Jolie was in it as well.</p>
